# Wallet App: Web Server Application

Current web server application was built with RESTful architecture in mind.
The server allows to:

- create new users with email and password
- authenticate users
- get current user information

- create new transactions for income and/or expenses
- get all user's transactions and their total balance
- get statistics for certain period

## Documentation

The server provides endpoints to work with.
The endpoints are documented here:
